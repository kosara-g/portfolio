# What is Vale?

**Vale** is a linter for text, or prose, that can help you identify issues with spelling, punctuation, wording, style, and more. You can apply off-the-shelf linting rules or customize them. You can also choose between three severity level: `error`, `warning`, and `suggestion`.

Vale relies on collections of rules, or *packages*, which are Vale-compatible implementations of existing third-party style guides.

The linter can spot the more trivial mistakes, allowing peer reviewers to focus on more high-level aspects of the documentation.
