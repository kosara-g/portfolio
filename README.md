# About this portfolio

> :information_source: **This is a work in progress**.

This portfolio contains a collection of writing samples, which cover tools I use in my professional work.

## [Vale tutorial series](./guides/Vale/vale-series.md)

While using Vale, I realized there were plenty of how-to articles and blog posts on setting up and running the linter but I was missing a condensed version with just the instructions. That's why I decided to summarize my experience of using the tool.

## Redocly CLI tutorial series

*Coming soon*.
